# CHANGELOG

# 5.0
5.0 is a compatibility update so the project builds in Swift 2.2 and doesn't generate warnings. It also changes the Objective-C names of the public enums, which Swift now supports.

**Bug Fixes:**
- Prioritize `textColorForAction()` over the `tintColor` of an action
- Properly exposes `visualStyle` as a property on `SDCAlertController` in Objective-C
- Makes `actionLayout` a non-optional, allowing it to be exposed to Objective-C
- Exposes a public init method in `DefaultVisualStyle` so subclassers don't have to implement this separately
- Correctly shows buttons if an alert has scrollable content after rotation
- Fixes incorrect accessibility labels on buttons

## 4.0.1
**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixes incorrect fonts for text in alerts

## 4.0
**What's New:**
- Adds support for presenting action sheets
- Implements alert behaviors such as parallax and "tap outside to dismiss"
- Action highlight colors can be changed with custom visual styles

**Changes:**
This version introduces other changes that are not compatible with previous
versions of `SDCAlertView`.
- The `automaticallyFocusFirstTextField` property is now implemented as an alert behavior
- In Objective-C, the presentation and dismissal methods are now named `presentAnimated:completion:` and `dismissAnimated:completion:` to follow Objective-C nomenclature more closely
- The title and message label fonts are removed from `VisualStyle`. To change the labels' fonts, please use `attributedTitle` and `attributedMessage` with `NSFontAttributeName` instead.
- `setShouldDismissHandler()` and `setVisualStyle()` are now properties named `shouldDismissHandler` and `visualStyle` respectively. Their functionality is unchanged.
- The convenience method `showWithTitle(_:message:actionTitle:customView:)` has been renamed to `alertWithTitle(_:message:actionTitle:customView:)` to provide more consistency with the action sheet's counterpart

### 1.1

**Bug Fixes:**
- The alert's background is no longer using the toolbar hack (#16 & #17)
- Accessing a text field before calling `show` does not cause a crash anymore (#14)

## 1.0

This release marks the first official release of SDCAlertView.

Beta release
